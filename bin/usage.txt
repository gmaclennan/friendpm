USAGE:

  friendpm i, install [-S] [-D]

    Works like `npm install`. Accepts a package name to install from someone on
    the local network, or your own cache if none are found.

  friendpm publish

    Works like `npm publish`, except your package is only published to your
    local cache. It can be installed immediately after by you or others on the
    network (if you're running `friendpm share`).

  friendpm share

    Run a tiny npm registry that other `friendpm` users can discover and use
    over the local network.
